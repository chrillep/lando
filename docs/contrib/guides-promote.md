# Promoting a guide

Promotion of your guide content is obviously at your own discretion but a few recommended ideas are below:

* Tweet at us [@devwithlando](https://twitter.com/devwithlando).
* Post on Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.
* Send to a periodical/newsletter such as [The Weekly Drop](http://www.theweeklydrop.com/).

## Co-marketing

If you would like to take advantage of Lando's marketing channels, just jump in the **#social** channel in our [Slack org](https://launchpass.com/devwithlando) and tell us what content you want us to promote!

We are always happy to retweet, send out in our newsletter, etc!
